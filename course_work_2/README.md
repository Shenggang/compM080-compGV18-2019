1. Gaussian curvature: Gaussian curvature only depends on angle deficit AND your A_i. the choices of A_i includes Barycentric area and Voronoi area. 
2. curvature visualization: just make sure you can see the difference between flat area and complex area. 

3. question 3, eigenvectors of the Laplace-Beltrami : please use cotanget version
