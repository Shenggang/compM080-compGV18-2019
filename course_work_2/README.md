# Coursework 2 F&Q list


1. Gaussian curvature: Gaussian curvature only depends on angle deficit AND your A_i. the choices of A_i includes Barycentric area and Voronoi area. 
2. curvature visualization: just make sure you can see the difference between flat area and complex area. 

3. question 3, eigenvectors of the Laplace-Beltrami : please use cotanget version

4. Spectra and Eigen: Spectra requires Eigen 3.3.7. check your eigen's major version before use it:  
`	std::cout<<"eigen version.:"<<EIGEN_WORLD_VERSION<<","<<EIGEN_MAJOR_VERSION  << EIGEN_MINOR_VERSION<<"\n";`
